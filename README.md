This repository contains Python code examples and explanations for fundamental data science libraries: NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib,streamlib
*** do not run whole code at a time learn each step and then try to write from your self ***
**you can also help the chatgpt and youtube and read the documentaion when faced any probelm **
## NumPy

- **Overview:** NumPy is a Python library for numerical and array operations. It provides support for multi-dimensional arrays and various mathematical functions.

- **Key Concepts:**
  - Creating arrays
  - Array attributes: shape, size, dtype
  - Element-wise operations
  - Indexing and slicing arrays
  - Aggregation and statistical functions
  - Broadcasting
  - Random number generation
  
- **Examples:** [Link to NumPy Examples](numpy_examples.py)

## pandas

- **Overview:** pandas is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis. It introduces two main data structures: Series and DataFrame.
   -
- **Key Concepts:**
  - Series: Creating and manipulating one-dimensional labeled arrays
  - DataFrame: Working with two-dimensional labeled data structures
  - Reading and writing data from/to CSV files
  - Data cleaning: Handling missing values and duplicates
  - Grouping and aggregation
  - Selecting, filtering, and sorting data
  
- **Examples:** [Link to pandas Examples](pandas.py)

## Matplotlib

- **Overview:** Matplotlib is a Python library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.

- **Key Concepts:**
  - Creating various types of plots: line, scatter, bar, histogram, pie, etc.
  - Customizing plots with colors, markers, labels, titles, legends, and gridlines
  - Subplots: Creating multiple plots in a single figure
  - Annotations: Adding text and arrows to plots
  - Error bars: Displaying variability in data
  - Logarithmic scales: Plotting data on log scales
  - 3D plots: Creating three-dimensional visualizations
  
- **Examples:** [Link to Matplotlib Examples](matplotlib.py)
